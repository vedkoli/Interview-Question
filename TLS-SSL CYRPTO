1) Symmetric encryption (AES, ChaCha20) is used for encrypting the actual data.
2) Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECDHE, DH) is used for key exchange and authentication.
3) Hashing (SHA-256, SHA-384, HMAC) is used for integrity and verification.
4) Digital signatures (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA) ensure the authenticity of the parties.
