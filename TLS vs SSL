SSL 3.0   
TLS 1.0 1.1   
TLS 1.2   
TLS 1.3   

They are cryptographic protocols used to provide secure communication over a computer network, Internet.
Both use RSA for key exchange

___________Difference _____________
SSL : MD5, SHA-1 / key exchnage - KEA           /  Encryption : DES,RC4
TLS : SHA-256    / key exchnage - DHE,ECDH,PSK  /  Encryption : AES


1. Hello from Client.
2. Hello from Server.
3. ( Certificate containing servers public key. ) sign by CA's Private key.
4. Client can verify certificate by CA's public key and get Server public key also.
5. Clinet sents Session key to server  encrpted by Server public key.


######## TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV  ##########

TLS Signaling Cipher suite value protect against TLS/SSL  DOWNGRDAE VALUE using poodle.

While TLS handshake the highest possible protocol is used.

Downgrading or poddle attack can lead to older version of SSL being used which can lead to MITM attack (BEAST ATTACK , Lucky13)
When we enable TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV A DUMMY OR FAKE CIPHER SUITE listed during the client hello message to the server. This workaround is TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV  signal.

It should support on client and server side .
Althoug this does not garantee downgrading so taking security meases like disbaling weak ciphers is must
