1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
  Eavesdropping: Intercepting and listening to the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
  Session Hijacking: Gaining unauthorized access to a session between a client and a server by stealing or predicting session tokens.
  SSL Stripping: Downgrading a secure HTTPS connection to an unencrypted HTTP connection to intercept traffic.
3. Phishing and Spear Phishing
4. IP Spoofing: Sending packets with a forged source IP address to appear as though they are coming from a trusted source, often used in DoS or DDoS attacks.
5. Brute Force Attacks
6.DNS Spoofing: Corrupting the cache of a DNS resolver to redirect traffic to malicious websites instead of the intended legitimate sites.
7.ARP Spoofing: An attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to link their MAC address with an IP address of a
legitimate system, allowing the attacker to intercept network traffic.
8. Rogue DHCP: An attacker sets up a malicious DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server, causing clients to receive 
malicious IP configurations, redirecting them to attacker-controlled systems.
9.Session Fixation: An attacker fixes a userâ€™s session ID before the user logs in, allowing the attacker to hijack the session once the user authenticates.
