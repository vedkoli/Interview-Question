SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection)
It occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web application's template engine.
Template engines are used to dynamically generate web pages by combining templates (HTML, XML, etc.) with data
When user input is improperly handled, an attacker can inject template code, causing the server to execute 
unexpected actions, such as executing arbitrary code or accessing sensitive data.

e.g., {{ user_name }}
Hello, {{ user_name }}! Welcome to your profile.

If the application directly injects this input into the template without sanitizing it,
the template engine might treat {{ config }} as a command to access the application's configuration object.

E.G :
${7*7}
${{7*7}}
{{7*7}}
#{7*7}
${{7*7}}
#{7*7}
<%= 7*7 %>

Remidation:
Input Validation and Sanitization
Use Safe Template Engines
Whitelist Inputs: Limit the types of data that can be used in templates,
