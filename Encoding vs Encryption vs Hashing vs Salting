Encoding:==================
Purpose: Makes data readable or transportable in certain environments (e.g., emails or URLs).
Reversible: Yes. You can decode it back to the original format.
Example: A file converted to Base64 encoding can be sent via email. It can be decoded back to its original form.


Encryption:===================
Purpose: Protects data confidentiality by making it unreadable without the decryption key.
Reversible: Yes, but only with the correct key.
Example: If a message is encrypted using AES, only someone with the decryption key can read it.

Hashing:========================
Purpose: Generates a fixed-size representation of data, useful for verifying data integrity or storing passwords securely.
Reversible: No, it’s a one-way operation. The original data can’t be recovered from the hash.
Example: Hashing a password ensures it’s stored as a fixed-length value. Even if someone steals the hash, they can't reverse it to get the original password.

Salting:======================
Purpose: Adds random data (salt) to the input before hashing to prevent attackers from using precomputed hash databases (like rainbow tables).
Reversible: No, but it makes the hash unique even for identical inputs.
Example: Two users with the same password will have different hashes if different salts are used.

###############Key Points #############
Encoding: For readability and transport (reversible).
Encryption: For data security (reversible with a key).
Hashing: For data verification (irreversible).
Salting: To enhance security of hashed data (irreversible, but prevents common attacks)
